## Abstract
The Swift Protocol is an implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that provides Universal Basic Income. The Swift currency is desgined to be used a transactional currency and has been designed with nearly instant transaction times, ability to scale to thousands of transactions per second, low transaction fees, and protections for buyers and sellers. Income is distributed on a daily basis to all participants and represents the concept of UBI.

## DAO based governance
The Swift Protocol uses a DAO to connect real world control with the blockchain. Different types of users have the ability to vote and change how the system functions based on real world events. This allows the Swift Protocol to remain decentralized  avoiding single points of failure while still enabling identity verification and financial controls.

### Swift Citizens
Swift Citizens are unique inidividuals that have been validated by an Idenity Provider. Citizens have the ability to add claim to the blockchain once every day (days begin and end at midnight UTC). Swifts will be awarded based on the amount of days passed with a maximum of 7. For example, if the 3 days have passed and a user makes a claim with the current production rate resting at 100 Swifts. 300 Swifts will be awarded.

### Delegated Nodes
Delegated Nodes are responsibile for maintaining full nodes and creating new blocks. Each election cycle Swift Citizens will sign votes to help choose which Delegated Nodes they would like to represent them. Delegated nodes have the capability to reach consensus on a daily basis to remove or add other Delegated Nodes and Identity Providers.

### Identity Providers
Identity Providers are responsible for validating the identity of Swift Citizens and creating new citizens by generating a keypair for each new Swift Citizen and including it on the blockchain. Identity Providers have the added responsibility of protecting the Swift Citizens whose keys they control with buyer and seller protections.
