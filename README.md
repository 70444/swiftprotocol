# Swift Protocol Whitepaper

The Swift Protcol is a DAO based protocol that implements the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI)

**https://www.swiftdemand.com/**

## Abstract
The Swift Protocol is an implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that provides Universal Basic Income. The Swift currency is desgined to be used a transactional currency and has been designed with nearly instant transaction times, ability to scale to thousands of transactions per second, low transaction fees, and protections for buyers and sellers. Income is distributed on a daily basis to all participants and represents the concept of UBI.

## DAO based governance
The Swift Protocol uses a DAO to connect real world control with the blockchain. Different types of users have the ability to vote and change how the system functions based on real world events. This allows the Swift Protocol to remain decentralized  avoiding single points of failure while still enabling identity verification and financial controls.

### Swift Citizens
Swift Citizens are unique inidividuals that have been validated by an Idenity Provider. Citizens have the ability to add claim to the blockchain once every day (days begin and end at midnight UTC). Swifts will be awarded based on the amount of days passed with a maximum of 7. For example, if the 3 days have passed and a user makes a claim with the current production rate resting at 100 Swifts. 300 Swifts will be awarded.

### Delegated Nodes
Delegated Nodes are responsibile for maintaining full nodes and creating new blocks. Each election cycle Swift Citizens will sign votes to help choose which Delegated Nodes they would like to represent them. Delegated nodes have the capability to reach consensus on a daily basis to remove or add other Delegated Nodes and Identity Providers.

### Identity Providers
Identity Providers are responsible for validating the identity of Swift Citizens and creating new citizens by generating a keypair for each new Swift Citizen and including it on the blockchain. Identity Providers have the added responsibility of protecting the Swift Citizens whose keys they control with buyer and seller protections.

## Income Distribution
Swifts are distributed to users on a daily basis and will max out at 7 unclaimed days of Swifts.

### Amount
The total amount of Swifts that are targeted to be added to the economy in the initial stage is 80 Billion. After this stage has been reached stage 2 will kick in limiting the amount of new Swifts that enter the economy to a healthy inflation rate.

**Stage 1:**  In the first stage income will be generated at an accelerated rate so the economy can grow to maturity within a shorter time period. During this period Swift Citizens will receive Swifts dependent on the amount of Swift Citizens that are in the ecosystem. The formula to calculate the Income Distribution Multiplier is as follows: (781250 / (5^(log10(users)))) with a maximum value of 100, and minimum value of 1.

**Stage 2:** After the 80 Billion cap has been reached by following the formula of Stage 1, Stage 2 will come into effect. During this stage new Swifts will be given out to users at an inflation rate decided by the Delegated Nodes to all users in the ecosystem. The target inflation rate is ~5% per year to maintain a healhy economy.

**Region Multiplier:** Several different income tiers will exist based on cost of living associated with each region. The tiers and the multipliers associated with them will be decided by the Delegated Nodes. The region that each citizen belongs to will be validated by Identity Providers when added to the blockchain.
